# Create your first React Native mobile app - Haze API App

In this workshop we will be creating a React Native mobile app using Expo. We will use an API \(Application Programming Interface\) as the input/resources/database for the mobile application. The app would consume the JSON resources provided by the API to create a presentable interface where the user can check the daily haze Air Pollution Index in their mobile devices.

## Before you start

* At least some basic understanding of programming is needed, preferably in JavaScript as this is the main language used throughout this course

## Goals 

1. Understand the basic concept of React/React Native
2. Publish the app to a website or at least run it on your phone 

## Overview
