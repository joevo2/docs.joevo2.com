# Creating your own Flappy Bird

## Before you start

* At least some basic understanding of programming is needed, preferably in JavaScript as this is the main language used throughout this course

_PS: But no worries, armed with just common sense and a bit of patience you can go through this workshop as well. If you need any help you can just raise your hand or message me at @joevo2_

## Goals 

1. Create your own game using Expo + Three.js
2. Publish the app to a website or at least run it on your phone 

_**Extended**  
Export the Expo Snack project,_ [_run it locally_](https://expo.io/learn) _with Expo, initialise the project with Git and push it to your own GitHub repository so that you can showcase to the world what you've done and brag during interview :D_ 

## Overview

* We will be using [Expo Snack](http://snack.expo.io) online editor as the main tools to create this application.
* We will need your iOS or Android phone installed with the[ Expo mobile app](https://expo.io/tools#client), so that the app can tested on your phone as Three.js cannot run in the Expo Snack web environment.
* Most of the workshop content will be based off this [official tutorial](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v31.0.0/tutorials/create-floatyplane-game/) written by [@Baconbrix](https://twitter.com/Baconbrix). Do give him a tweet of appreciation :\) 

_**Extended**   
You can download the source code with Expo Snack and run it on your local machine, push to GitHub and have your own production build of the app._

## Getting started

Let's fire up [Expo Snack](http://snack.expo.io) and clone our first repository
