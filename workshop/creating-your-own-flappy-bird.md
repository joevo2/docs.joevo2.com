# Creating your own Flappy Bird

## Goals 

1. Create your very first game using Expo
2. Have your own GitHub repository of this app that you wrote yourself to showcase to the world or just brag during interview :D 
3. Publish the app to a website or at least run it on your phone 

## Overview

* We will be using Expo as the main tools for us to create this application 
* Most of the workshop content will be based on this [official tutorial](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v31.0.0/tutorials/create-floatyplane-game/) written by [@Baconbrix](https://twitter.com/Baconbrix). Do give him a tweet of appreciation :\) 

## Expectation from you

* At least some basic understanding of programming is needed, preferably in JavaScript as this is the main language used throughout this course
